https://deniskuchko.github.io/Slider-React-/

  This slider is written in Reacte without using third-party libraries. Hooks were used( such as useState, useEffect, useRef).
  In the index start file.js you can specify the indent between slides: between={5} (where the number is the number of pixels), as well as the number of slides on the page: itemInSlide ={2}. 
  At the bottom are elements that indicate the number of slides and their number. They are also active.
